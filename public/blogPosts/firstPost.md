# Hello, world!

This is the first post I am making for this little space I've created here on bradleygoldsmith.org. I hope to update this blog often enough and keep a chronicle of what's going on in my life, any projects I'm working on, or any opinions and thoughts I feel like putting down in ink (or pixels).

## So, what is going on?

Mostly, I've been just living life in New York City. Some (more or less) recent things:

- I was accepted into Georgia Tech's Computer Science Masters Program for Spring 2025
- I collaborated with some awesome people on a couple of art projects (shoutout to Connor and the SMART museum)
- I have been learning Spanish
- I got a cat named Alice, and she's the sweetest and cutest little lady in the world

I am still working as a web developer, hanging out with my Partner, and being in my mid-20s.

## What will I post?

I'm really just excited to post here about any ideas or projects I am working on--books I'm reading, TV shows I'm binging, or pictures and art I create. Look out for more soon!
