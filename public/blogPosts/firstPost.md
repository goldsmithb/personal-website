# Hello, world!

Reader, I have a radical, dare I say unprecedented idea: I've decided to create a space on the internet where I can put some written content.

Bear with me: I hope to use this blog to keep a chronicle of what's going on in my life, write about any projects I'm working on, or any opinions and thoughts I feel like setting down in ink (well, pixels). If that sort of Bradley content interests you, welcome aboard! If not, well, I hope you find some entertainment at the least.

## So, lately

I've been just living life in New York City. Some (more or less) recent things:

- I was accepted into Georgia Tech's Computer Science Masters Program for Spring 2025
- I collaborated with some awesome people on a couple of art projects (shoutout to Connor and the SMART museum)
- I have been learning Spanish
- I've done some traveling (Argentina and Puerto Rico)
- I got a cat named Alice, and she's the sweetest, cutest little lady in the world

Other than that I am still working as a web developer, spending time with my partner and being in my mid-20s.

## Why?

Honestly I'm not sure what this blog will turn out like. I suppose I have a certain inner impulse to write again. Not quite sure what I have to say exactly, perhaps I just miss the mental exercise. The converging of thoughts onto the page narrows the attention, has a calming effect on the mind. Make up crap like that, you know? Also, I do want to make use of the React components I coded.
So,
read on if you must!
