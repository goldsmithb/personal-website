# Hello, world.

This is the first post I am making for this little space I've carved out here on bradleygoldsmith.org. I hope to update this blog often enough and keep a chronicle of what's going on in my life, any projects I'm working on, or any opinions and thoughts I feel like putting down in ink and pixels. And it's better to do it here, where there is no pressure from algorithms and followers to be perceived in a certain way, and I get complete control over how the whole thing functions, because I'm the monkey who coded it.

- I collaborated with some awesome people on a couple of art projects
- I have been studying Spanish and have become quite proficient
- I got a cat named Alice, and she's the sweetest and most polite little lady in New York

I am still working as a web developer, living in New York City, being in my mid-20s. But now that a few years have passed since the high melodrama of graduating college in a global pandemic, moving abroad and to be a barnacle on Vienna, and coming home to eke out a life in New York, I am taking stock before the next phase. And one thing I have found in my recent reflections is that I miss writing: writing as a therapeutic exercise, as a process of discovery, as a mode of thinking, as a vehicle for stories. I miss giving myself in to the flow of ideas and words from my temple to my fingers to the page. I miss the mystery and excitement of starting a project without a clear idea of where it will end--the faith required to believe I have something worth saying. And I miss the discipline it applies to my mind, and the simultaneous sense of orientation and disorientation that occurs when we try to order our raw thought-stuff into linear language. And also, the less I write, the more I talk, and I have a hypothesis that I can be quite... garrulous at times. So,
